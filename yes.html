    <h1>You Said Yes 💙</h1>

    <p>
  Okay… I won’t lie 😌<br>
  I’m really glad you said yes.<br><br>

  I don’t have everything figured out,<br>
  but one thing I know for sure is that<br>
  I want to do life with you.<br><br>

  You make me laugh, you calm me down,<br>
  and somehow you feel like home to me.<br><br>

  So yeah… it’s you.<br>
  And I’m choosing you. Every time.

      From the moment you walked into my life,<br>
      everything felt softer, calmer, right.<br><br>

      Your smile became my favorite place,<br>
      your heart my safest home.<br><br>

      Today, tomorrow, and always,<br>
      I choose you.
    </p>
